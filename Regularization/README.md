## Boston Housing Price Prediction 

This project uses the **Boston Housing Dataset** to predict the **median value of homes (MEDV)** based on 14 features describing Boston suburbs.
We start with a simple **linear regression model** as a baseline, then explore **L1 (Lasso)** and **L2 (Ridge)** regularization techniques to improve performance and reduce overfitting.

Regularization helps the model focus on the most important features and make more reliable predictions.
The project demonstrates how adding Lasso and Ridge can enhance a basic regression modelâ€™s accuracy and generalization.
